# pwp
Personal Website Project

Purpose- The PWP would allow me to display work in an openly accessible place, showing off skills with front and back end development.

Audience- The site would be aimed toward potential employers and peers to give them a bite size view of the scope of my skills and understanding.

Goal- My goal is to become gainfully employed, and preferably something full time.

This project will be used to develop my personal website, I hope to end up using it for displaying some work to potential employers and peers.
